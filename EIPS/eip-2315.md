## Abstract

This proposal introduces two opcodes to support simple subroutines:
* `RJUMPSUB` call to subroutine
* `RETURNSUB` return from call

It depends on two previously proposed opcodes:
* `RJUMP` relative jump
* `RJUMPI` conditional relative jump

It deprecates `JUMP` and `JUMPI`.

It provides constraints on code and an algorithm for code validation to provide a _static_, _complete_, _efficient_, and _safe_ control-flow facility.

## Motivation

Subroutines were first proposed by Alan Turing in 1945 as a means of structuring code for his Automatic Computing Engine:
> We also wish to be able to arrange for the splitting up of operations into subsidiary operations ... To start on a subsidiary operation we need only make a note of where we left off the major operation and then apply the first instruction of the subsidiary.  When the subsidiary is over we look up the note and continue with the major operation.

Facilities vary, but operations like these have proven their value for efficient implementation and straightforward coding of subroutines across a long line of machines going back over 75 years.  This includes all of the machines we have programmed or implemented -- physical machines like the Burroughs 5000, CDC 7600, IBM 360, PDP-11, VAX, M68000, Sun SPARC, ARM, and Intel x86s as well as virtual machines for Lisp, Forth, Pascal, Java, Wasm, and others.

The Ethereum Virtual Machine does not provide subroutine operations. Instead, subroutines can be synthesized by pushing the return address and subroutine address on the data stack and executing a dynamic `JUMP` to the subroutine; returns can be synthesized by getting the return address to the top of the stack and doing another dynamic `JUMP` back to it.  These conventions cost gas, increase program size, and use stack slots unnecessarily.  And they create unnecessary complexity that is borne by the humans and programs writing, reading, and analyzing EVM code.

**We propose** -- together with [EIP-4200](./eip-4200.md) -- to replace dynamic jumps with a _complete, static, efficient_ and _safe_ control-flow facility.
* _Complete_. Jumps, conditional jump, subroutine call, and subroutine returns.
* _Static_.  All control paths are known at contract initialization time.
* _Efficient_.  Substantial reductions in the costs and complexity of calling and optimizing simple subroutines.
* _Safe_. Simple rules and validtion algorithm to ensure that code will not underflow stack, jump to invalid locations, or execute invalid instructions.

## Specification

### Opcodes

#### `RJUMPSUB (0x??) jmpdest: uint16`

Transfers control to a subroutine.

1. Decode the `destination` from the immediate data at `pc`.
2. Push the current `pc + 3` to the `return stack`.
3. Set `pc` to `destination`.

The gas cost is _low_.

#### `RETURNSUB (0x??)`

Returns control to the caller of a subroutine.

1. Pop the `return stack` to `PC`.

The destination address is relative to the current PC. The address is encoded as a two-byte, twos-complement signed integer, stored MSB-first.

The gas cost is _verylow_.

_Notes:_
* _Values popped off the `return stack` do not need to be validated, since they are alterable only by `RJUMPSUB` and `RETURNSUB`._ 
* _The description above lays out the semantics of these instructions in terms of a `return stack`.  But the actual state of the `return stack` is not observable by EVM code or consensus-critical to the protocol.  (For example, a node implementer may code `RJUMPSUB` to unobservably push `PC` on the `return stack` rather than `PC + 1`, which is allowed so long as `RETURNSUB` observably returns control to the `PC + 3 location.)_

### Code Validation

If the execution of an instruction would violate a condition, then the execution is in an exceptional halting state. The Yellow Paper defines five such states.
1. Insufficient gas
2. More than 1024 stack items
3. Insufficient stack items
4. Invalid jump destination
5. Invalid instruction

We would like to consider EVM code valid iff no execution of the program can lead to an exceptional halting state.  In practice, we must test at runtime for conditions 1 and 2 —- sufficient gas and sufficient stack.  We don’t know how much gas there will be, we don’t know how deep a recursion may go, and analysis of stack depth even for non-recursive programs is nontrivial.  All of the remaining conditions MUST be validated statically, in time and space linear in the size of the code.

#### Constraints on Valid Code

* Every instruction MUST be valid.
   * The `JUMP` and `JUMPI` instructions ARE NOT valid.
* Every jump MUST be valid:
   * The `RJUMP`, `RJUMPI`, or `RJUMPSUB` instructions MUST NOT address immediate data.
* The stacks MUST always be valid:
   * The number of items on the `data stack` MUST always be positive, and at most 1024.
   * The number of items on the `return stack`MUST always be positive, and at most 1024.
* The data stack MUST be consistently aligned:
   * The number of items on the `data stack` between the current `stack pointer` and the `stack pointer` on entry to the most recent subroutine MUST be the same for each _execution_ of a _byte_code_.

## Rationale

The `RJUMP`, `RJUMPI` and `RJUMPSUB` instructions take their destination as an immediate argument, which cannot change at runtime.

Having constant destinations for all jumps means that all jump destinations can be validated at initialization time, not runtime.

Requiring a consistently aligned`data stack` prevents stack underflow. It can also catch irreducible control flows and calls to subroutines with the wrong number of arguments.

Taken together, these rules allow for EVM code to be validated by traversing its control-flow graph, in time and space linear in the size of the code, following each edge only once.

### Costs

The _low_ cost of `RJUMPSUB` versus the _mid_ cost of `JUMP` is justified by needing only to decode the immediate two byte destination to the `PC` and push the return address on the `return stack`, all using native arithmetric, versus using the data stack with emulated 256-bit instructions.

The _verylow_ cost of `RETURNSUB` is justified by needing only to pop the `return stack` into the `PC`.  Benchmarking will be needed to tell if the costs are well-balanced.

### Alternatives

There are a few major designs for a subroutine facility, two of which are considered here.  The others are mostly not appropriate for the EVM, such as self-modifying code that writes return addresses into called subroutines.

#### *Keep return addresses on a dedicated return stack.*

Turing's design is often used in stack machines, including those for Forth, Java, Wasm, and others.  The data stack is almost entirely used for computation, with a dedicated stack for return addresses.

#### *Keep return addresses on the data stack.* 

This design is used by all of the register machines we have programmed.  The registers are used primarily for computation, and the stack contains call frames for return addresses, arguments, and local variables.

#### **We prefer the separate control stack.**
* It maintains a clear separation between calculation and flow of control:
  * the data stack is free of vulnerable return addresses and
  * it's impossible to overwrite the return stack.
* It improves efficiency:
  * uses native arithmetic rather than 256-bit EVM instructions for the return address,
  * doesn't use a `data stack` slot for the return address and
  * needs less motion of 256-bit data on the stack.
* It supports linear-time valiation.
* It has a 76-year history of success, especially on stack machines.

#### **We must use a separate control stack.**

On the EVM we use return addresses on the data stack using dynamic jumps, as shown below.  But dynamic jumps are an obstacle to proving validity in linear time.  Because they can be to any destination in the code, quadratic "path explosions" are possible when attempting the symbolic execution we need to validate the code.  This is why we propose to deprecate `JUMP` and `JUMPI`.

### Efficiency

We illustrate here how subroutine instructions can be used to reduce the complexity and gas costs of both ordinary and optimized subroutine calls compared to using `JUMP`.

#### **Simple Subroutine Call**

Consider these examples of a fairly minimal subroutine, including the code to call it.

Subroutine call, using `RJUMPSUB`:
```
TEST_SQUARE:
    0x02            ; 3 gas
    rjumpsub SQUARE ; 5 gas
    returnsub       ; 3 gas

SQUARE:
    dup1            ; 3 gas
    mul             ; 5 gas
    returnsub       ; 3 gas
```
_Total gas: 22_

Subroutine call, using `JUMP`:
```
TEST_SQUARE:
    jumpdest        ; 1 gas
    RTN_SQUARE      ; 3 gas
    0x02            ; 3 gas
    SQUARE          ; 3 gas
    jump            ; 8 gas

RTN_SQUARE:
    jumpdest        ; 1 gas
    swap1           ; 3 gas
    jump            ; 8 gas

SQUARE:
    jumpdest        ; 1 gas
    dup1            ; 3 gas
    mul             ; 5 gas
    swap1           ; 3 gas
    jump            ; 8 gas
```
_Total: 50 gas_.

Using `RJUMPSUB` versus `JUMP` saves _50 - 22 = 28 gas_ -- a _56%_ improvement.

#### **Tail Call Optimization**

Of course in cases like this one we can optimize the tail call, so that the return from `SQUARE` actually returns from `TEST_SQUARE`.

Tail call optimization, using `RJUMPSUB` and `RETURNSUB`:
```
TEST_SQUARE:
    0x02            ; 3 gas
    rjump SQUARE    ; 3 gas

SQUARE:
    dup1            ; 3 gas
    mul             ; 5 gas
    returnsub       ; 3 gas
```
_Total: 17 gas_


Tail call optimization, using `JUMP`:
```
TEST_SQUARE:
    jumpdest        ; 1 gas
    0x02            ; 3 gas
    SQUARE          ; 3 gas
    jump            ; 8 gas

SQUARE:
    jumpdest        ; 1 gas
    dup1            ; 3 gas
    mul             ; 5 gas
    swap1           ; 3 gas
    jump            ; 8 gas
```
_Total: 33 gas_

Using `RJUMPSUB` versus `JUMP` saves _33 - 17 = 16_ gas -- a _48%_ improvement.

#### Efficiency Caveats

We can see that these instructions provide a simpler and more gas-efficient subroutine mechanism than using `JUMP` -- in our examples they cut gas use by half. 

Clearly, the benefits of these efficiencies are greater for programs that have been factored into smaller subroutines.  How small?  A subroutine could use _90_ more gas than our first, _22_ gas example and `RJUMPSUB` would still use better than _20% less total gas_ than `JUMP`.

*Note:  A _stack rotation_ operator to move items on the stack and implicitly shift the intervening items could simplify code using `JUMP`. It would be a potentionally expensive operation with a dynamic gas cost.*

We specify a few simple safety rules to ensure that valid contracts will not underflow stack, jump to invalid locations, or execute invalid instructions.  We also provide an algorithm to validate these rules at initialization time.  The validation algorithm **must** have quasi-linear complexity to avoid being a DoS vulnerability, which in turn requires that the program control flow be static and that subroutine calls be distinguisable from ordinary jumps.  In combination with the static relative jumps of [EIP-4200](./eip-4200.md) this EIP provides the control flow needed for efficient validation.

## Backwards Compatibility

These changes affect the semantics of existing EVM code: bytes that would have been interpreted as valid jump destinations may now be interpreted as immediate data.  Since this proposal depends on the Ethereum Object Format to signal the change this is not a practical issue. 

## Test Cases

### Simple routine

This should jump into a subroutine, back out and stop.

Bytecode: `0x60045e005b5d` (`PUSH1 0x04, JUMPSUB, STOP, JUMPDEST, RETURNSUB`)

|  Pc   |      Op     | Cost |   Stack   |   RStack  |
|-------|-------------|------|-----------|-----------|
|    0  |    JUMPSUB  |    5 |        [] |        [] |
|    3  |  RETURNSUB  |    5 |        [] |       [0] |
|    4  |       STOP  |    0 |        [] |        [] |

Output: 0x
Consumed gas: `10`

### Two levels of subroutines

This should execute fine, going into one two depths of subroutines

Bytecode: `0x
00000000000000c5e005b60115e5d5b5d` (`PUSH9 0x00000000000000000c, JUMPSUB, STOP, JUMPDEST, PUSH1 0x11, JUMPSUB, RETURNSUB, JUMPDEST, RETURNSUB`)

|  Pc   |      Op     | Cost |   Stack   |   RStack  |
|-------|-------------|------|-----------|-----------|
|    0  |    JUMPSUB  |    5 |        [] |        [] |
|    3  |    JUMPSUB  |    5 |        [] |       [0] |
|    4  |  RETURNSUB  |    5 |        [] |     [0,3] |
|    5  |  RETURNSUB  |    5 |        [] |       [3] |
|    6  |       STOP  |    0 |        [] |        [] |

Consumed gas: `20`

### Failure 1: invalid jump

This should fail, since the given location is outside of the code-range. The code is the same as previous example, 
except that the pushed location is `0x01000000000000000c` instead of `0x0c`.

Bytecode: (`PUSH9 0x01000000000000000c, JUMPSUB, `0x6801000000000000000c5e005b60115e5d5b5d`, STOP, JUMPDEST, PUSH1 0x11, JUMPSUB, RETURNSUB, JUMPDEST, RETURNSUB`)

|  Pc   |      Op     | Cost |   Stack   |   RStack  |
|-------|-------------|------|-----------|-----------|
|    0  |    JUMPSUB  |   10 |[18446744073709551628] |        [] |

```
Error: at pc=10, op=JUMPSUB: invalid jump destination
```

### Failure 2: shallow `return stack`

This should fail at first opcode, due to shallow `return_stack`

Bytecode: `0x5d5858` (`RETURNSUB, PC, PC`)

|  Pc   |      Op     | Cost |   Stack   |   RStack  |
|-------|-------------|------|-----------|-----------|
|    0  |  RETURNSUB  |    5 |        [] |        [] |

```
Error: at pc=0, op=RETURNSUB: invalid retsub
```

### Subroutine at end of code

In this example. the JUMPSUB is on the last byte of code. When the subroutine returns, it should hit the 'virtual stop' _after_ the bytecode, and not exit with error

Bytecode: `0x6005565b5d5b60035e` (`PUSH1 0x05, JUMP, JUMPDEST, RETURNSUB, JUMPDEST, PUSH1 0x03, JUMPSUB`)

|  Pc   |      Op     | Cost |   Stack   |   RStack  |
|-------|-------------|------|-----------|-----------|
|    0  |      PUSH1  |    3 |        [] |        [] |
|    2  |       JUMP  |    8 |       [5] |        [] |
|    5  |   JUMPDEST  |    1 |        [] |        [] |
|    6  |    JUMPSUB  |    5 |        [] |        [] |
|    2  |  RETURNSUB  |    5 |        [] |       [2] |
|    7  |       STOP  |    0 |        [] |        [] |

Consumed gas: `30`

## Reference Implementation 

The following is a pseudo-Go implementation of an algorithm for predicating code validity.  An equivalent algorithm must be run at initialization time.  

This algorithm performs a symbolic execution of the program that recursively traverses the _code_, emulating its control flow and stack use and checking for violations of the rules above.

It runs in time equal to `O(vertices + edges)` in the program's control-flow graph, where edges represent control flow and the vertices represent _basic blocks_ -- thus the algorithm takes time proportional to the size of the _code_. It uses recursion to maintain a stack of continuations for conditional jumps, the size of which is at most proportional to the size of the _code_

*Note: All valid code has a control-flow graph that can be traversed in time and space linear in the length of the code, while avoiding stack underflow and misalignment.  That means that some other static analyses and code transformations that might otherwise require quadratic time can also be written to run in linear time, including linear-time complilers and streaming machine code generators.

### Validation Function

For simplicity's sake we assume that _jumpdest analysis_ has been done and that we have some helper functions.
* `is_valid_instruction(pc)` returns true if `pc` points at a valid instruction.
* `is_valid_jumpdest(dest)` returns true if `dest` is a valid jumpdest.
* `immediate_data(pc)` returns the immediate data for the instruction at `pc`.
* `advance_pc(pc)` advances to and returns the next `pc`,  skipping any immediate data.
* `removed_items(pc,sp)` returns the number of items removed from the `data_stack` by the instruction at `pc`.
* `add_items(pc,sp)` returns the number of items added to the `data_stack` by the instruction at `pc`.

## Security Considerations

These changes introduce new flow control instructions.  They do not introduce any new security considerations. This EIP is intended to improve security by validating a higher level of safety for EVM code deployed on the blockchain.
